FREEDOM SPACE 

This application was coded on CSS through a platform named The Marvel app. The reason for using a proprietary app making tool was because of its offerings in icons, toggles, free to use pictures, and ready made iphone outlines. I believe the application would not have been as aesthetic as it is, without the use of the Marvel App. The specifics, word placements, icon placements, toggle buttons were written on CSS. 

To access the ready made application, please follow the link provided below:

Note that some buttons such as the majority of the profile and settings are not functionable. If in doubt, click anyhwere on the screen and the clickable buttons will be highlighted. I hope you enjoy FREEDOM SPACE - A space from Injustice!
