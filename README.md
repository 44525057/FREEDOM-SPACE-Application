# The-good-place
Application about : FREEDOM SPACE is an application designed to prevent, educate and inform the public about injustices happening in their communities. Freedom space is also a safe space for discussing and organanising peaceful protests. 
FREEDOM SPACE will have features such as a forum, articles, DANGER MODE (which I will explain later), Profile creation tools among others. 
The problem space I was trying to explore was the fact that many people feel like injustice fills the air in the world we live in today. Personal safety is being compromised on a daily basis because of situations that are preventable. The primary concern of people all around the world, especially in Australia, is to be safe currently while being informed as well. I conducted several interviews which i will link below on these issues. 
How are we going to solve this mighty problem: The answer is crime and injustice go hand in hand in communities around Australia. THe majory concern many of the people i interviewed talked about was, how can a commoner tell their version of a story to the public. Much of the times the media and hive minded groups like to jump on the bandwagon and play the blame game on a single issues but injustice as a whole is not ONE SINGLE ISSUE. Its many problems hidden in plain sight and i believe one of the main ways we can alleviate injustice is through education, reform and prevention. Rather than cry out, "DEFUND THE POLICE", at the very sight of police injustice, how can could the people and law enforcement share sotries from their perspectives to the common man or woman.

Professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at Griffith University in Brisbane states that, the onus of crime prevention should not be solely put on law enforcement but through educating the common public, crime and injustice levels will go down. He also stated that injustice by the police should not be ignored for the "good of the department" but be bought forward and discussed among the public. That is exactly what i hope to establish with the FREEDOM SPACE application. A safe space where you are free to discuss injustices in the community and how we as a community could deal with them efficeiently. (Homel, 1994)
